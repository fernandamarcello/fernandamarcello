<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Oceanographic Institute of the University of São Paulo (IO-USP), Brazil, where I study the physical oceanography of the South Atlantic Ocean. Specifically, I have focused on its large-scale circulations which encompass the South Atlantic subtropical gyre and the upper limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Implications of my research include shedding light on possible climate change scenarios and improving our understanding of the ocean’s role in climate variability.
